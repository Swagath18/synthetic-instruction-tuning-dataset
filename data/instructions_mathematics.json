    "output": "The Pythagorean theorem is a fundamental principle in geometry, discovered by the ancient Greek mathematician Pythagoras. It states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. This can be written as: a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2, where c represents the length of the hypotenuse, and a and b represent the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nFor example, if you have a right-angled triangle with one side measuring 3 units, the other side measuring 4 units, and you want to find the length of the hypotenuse, you would use the Pythagorean theorem. \n\nAccording to the theorem, c\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2. By substituting the known values, we get c\u00b2 = 3\u00b2 + 4\u00b2 = 9 + 16 = 25. To find the length of the hypotenuse (c), we take the square root of 25, which is 5. \n\nSo, the length of the hypotenuse in this case is 5 units. This theorem is widely used in various fields including physics, engineering, computer science, architecture, and more."
